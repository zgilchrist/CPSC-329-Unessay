//rube-cubeman vs diffie-hellman

Diffie-Hellman is a symmetric public key exchange that relies upon the use of shared secrets.

Say Alice and Bob want to send each other a message and they want to use a key exchange to keep their message safe. 

They each have a part that is secret and in private domain. Say a,b for Alice and Bob respectively. 

There exists a part of the key, a root, in the public domain which we can call g.

Now, Alice and Bob combine their private secret a,b respectively with g to get ag, bg.

They now trade these new combinations with each other across the public domain. Such that a certain Eve could see it.

With these combinations they now combine their own part of their secret they had originally to get abg.

They can now both verify that abg is a match for both of them and that the exchange is in fact secure.

Rubie-Cubeman is a new tool for describing these realtionships of Diffie-Hellman but in a more easy to understand and educational manner.

The Rubiks cube is used as an analog for the complex mathmatical sequences by giving it states that Alice and Bob can both reach with different sets of rotations.

The cubes shown here are designed to demonstrate these principles.
