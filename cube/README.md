Cuber  
==============================================================================

Cuber is a Rubik’s Cube simulator.




Running Cuber
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__From the desktop__  
Simply drop the `index.html` file onto a Chrome browser window.

__From an ad-hoc server__  
From the command line type the following to create a server, where `8000` 
(the default) is an optional port number argument:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

__From Apache__  
The file `/.htaccess` is configured to require a valid login which you will 
need to configure on your own server. Alternatively this file can be removed
from the package entirely.




Methodology
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Separation of state and visuals__  
I wanted to keep the Cube’s internal state entirely separate and independent 
of the visual rendering as a way to hopefully allow for future ports to serve
new and unforeseen purposes. Sometimes it makes for what seems like redundancy
but I think in the long term it’ll be worth it. 

__Modularity__  
I’ve tried to break the problem down into what amounts to Classes. I’m a 
big fan of Prototypal Inheritance but I’m hoping this approach—including 
separating these Classes into separate files—makes things clear and easy.
Also it’s pretty awesome when you’re inspecting things via the console and 
the console can actually tell you that this particular Array holds Cubelets, 
for example. The bulk of the fun located in `/scripts/models/`. The app is 
controlled by `/scripts/models/erno.js`

__Global scope and the Console__  
Lambda functions are great. And namespacing components into wrapper objects
can be seriously useful. But I’ve purposely (and carefully) placed a lot
of important bits right into the main scope so that tinkerers may pop open 
Chrome’s JavaScript Console and start poking around. This also makes it easy 
to write bookmarklets or other hacks.

__Documentation__  
Through code comments I’ve tried very hard to be as clear as possible about
what I’m doing and why I’m doing it. This is only partially altruism. 
It’s perhaps primarily so I can have some chance of understanding my own code
at some future date. Ever write an app and come back to it six months later?
Yea. It’s a problem. That’s why I comment so heavily.




JavaScript console fun
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Inspection__  
I’ve endeavored to make the Cube highly inspectable from both third-party 
scripts and by humans using the browser’s console. To get a quick sense of 
what’s possible try out each of the following commands. (It’s fun!)
```
cube.inspect()  
cube.inspect( true )  
cube.front  
cube.front.northWest.inspect()  
cube.front.northWest.up.color.name  
```
To understand the basic vocabulary and mapping of the Cube and Cubelets see 
the comments at the head of `cube.js`, `slices.js`, and `cubelets.js` within
the `/scripts` folder. (Also, if your browser does not support CSS styling 
within the console you’re going to have a bad time.)

__Manipulation__  
It’s also easy to alter properties of the Cube like so:
```
cube.standing.setOpacity( 0.1 )  
cube.corners.setRadius( 90 )  
cube.corners.getRadius( 90 )  
```
These functions are chainable. And really, who doesn’t love chaining?
```
cube.hidePlastics().hideStickers().showWireframes().showIds()
```
If you’re hungry for more check out `groups.js` to see all the goodies.

__Search__  
Lurking around `groups.js` you’ll also spot some filtering functions: 

```
cube.hasColors( RED, BLUE ).showIds()  
cube.hasId( 0 )//  A Cubelet’s ID never changes.  
cube.hasAddress( 0 )//  But its address changes when it moves.  
cube.hasProperty( 'address', 0 )//  Equivalent to previous line.  
```
And guess what—these are also chainable. (I know, right?!)
```
cube.hasColors( RED, BLUE ).hasType( 'corner' ).setRadius( 90 )
```

__Solving__  
The infrastructure for writing solvers is more or less there. Calling 
`cube.solve()` will set `cube.isSolving = true` and then with each run through
`cube.loop()` the selected solver will be asked to assess the Cube. I’ve 
provided the bare beginnings of a simple layer-by-layer solver. Sadly, I only 
got as far as solving the Top Cross but hopefully the solver’s code comments 
and verbose console output can serve as a primer for you to write your own!
Lagniappe: While writing the solver it seemed really helpful to fully define
the idea of _orientation_ / _direction_ so I wrote a Class and some STATICs 
that make comparing directions a little easier. (See `directions.js` for 
details.)
```
FRONT.getOpposite() === BACK  
FRONT.neighbors  
FRONT.getClockwise()  
FRONT.getClockwise( 2 )  
```
The spacial mapping used here is defined at the head of `cubelets.js`. 
Whatever face you’re looking at has an inherrent ‘up’ and from that reference
point you can ask what face we’d be looking at if we rotated clockwise by a
90 degree twist, for example. 
```
FRONT.getUp() === UP  
FRONT.getClockwise() === RIGHT  
UP.getUp() === BACK  
UP.getRotation( -1, LEFT )  
```
It gets weird pretty quickly but once you’re in the correct headspace these 
functions become incredibly useful. Why do all this rather than hardcore 
matrix math? Because 42.




Code typography
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Semicolons__  
First, I only use semicolons when absolutely necessary. By definition any
valid JavaScript interpreter _must_ perform automatic semicolon insertion. 
This means you just don’t need them. Let me repeat: YOU JUST DON’T NEED THEM.
Leaving them out makes your code typographically cleaner; reduces visual 
clutter and noise in the signal. It’s good for your soul.

__Whitespace__  
I use tabs, not spaces for codeblock indentation—functions, object blocks, and
so on. Tab is the only true unit of indentation. My tabs are the width of four
spaces. Two is too small. Eight is just too damn wide. Within lines of code 
I’ll often add bits of whitespace to line up consecutive equal signs or other
recurring symbols if it’s subtle and not too wonky:
```  
right = 2  
left  = 3  
```  

I’ll often add a space between an open-parenthesis and a token; same for 
between a token and close-parenthesis. Line breaks after an open bracket are
also desirable. 

__Comments__  
Two line breaks before line comments. One line break after them. Two spaces 
following a comment’s slashes. (One for hanging quotation marks in order to
optically align the text itself.) For critical to-do’s I add two juxtaposed
ampersats to both visually separate them and make them easy to search for. 
Just a quirk of mine. Occasionally if the situation calls for it I’ll use 
special “rhombus” commnents for big visual breaks. They have three horizontal 
spaces between slashes and text and vertical padding inside like so:  
```  
    /////////////////  
   //             //  
  //   Rhombus   //  
 //             //  
/////////////////  
```  
I pad these rhombus comments with four line breaks above and two below.
