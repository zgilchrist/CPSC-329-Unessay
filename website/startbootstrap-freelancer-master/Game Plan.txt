A: Add delay before/after B-values populate fields tooltip 5.) *Fri, Nov 27*

A: *if you have extra time* figure out how to make animations smoooooooooother

--- // Tool Tips// ---

Z: Tool tip implementation **TBD** *Probably one of the last steps to do*

1. Start Button
-> initiates text pop-up sequence

2. "Enter H-sequence"

-> user inputs H: LJisidh
-> user hits: "submit"

3. "Enter G-sequence"

-> user inputs G: LJisidh
-> user hits: "submit"

3. "Enter A0"
-> user inputs A0: 9
-> user hits: "submit"

4. "Enter A1"
-> user inputs A1: 5
-> user hits: "submit"

5. "Bob enters B1 & B0"
-> fill out B1 field:
-> fill out B2 field:

//Step 1
6."Alice iterates through G squence A0 times"
-> cube in Alice's column animates

-- Pause

7. "Bob interates through G sequence B0 times"
-> cube in Bob's column animates

-- Pause

8. "Bob give his cube to Alice. Alice gives her cube to Bob."

//Step 2
9. "Alice iterates through G sequence A0 times. 
Then she iterates through H sequence A1 times."
-> cube in Alice's column animates

-- Pause

10. "Bob iterates through G sequence B0 times. 
Then she iterates through H sequence B1 times."
-> cube in Bob's column animates

-- Pause

11. "Bob give his cube to Alice. Alice gives her cube to Bob.
They now have the same cubes they started with."
-> cube in Bob's column animates

//Step 3
12. "Alice iterates through H squence A1 times."
-> cube in Alice's column animates

--Pause

13. "Bob iterates through H squence B1 times."
-> cube in Bob's column animates

14. "The cubes appear the same!


// Game Plan Continued... //

T: Create directional buttons to rotate cubes

T: Clean up UI a bit (link nav bar properly, etc)

T: 4 x 3 keyboard & add "Randomize" button

A: H & G input field previews isolated

A: H & G cube moves input range from 1 to 5 moves

Z: Add copyright to README field

ALL: Write peer assessments and self assessments
