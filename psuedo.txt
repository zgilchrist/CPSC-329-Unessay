//PUBLIC KEY//
Public Parameters: Take G & H input (random or user input)

 (user input)
 create buttons to take cube moves (eg. "F" "Li" etc.)



 	NOTATION

	UPPERCASE = Clockwise to next 90 degree peg
	lowercase = Anticlockwise to next 90 degree peg



	FACE & SLICE ROTATION COMMANDS

	F	Front
	S 	Standing (rotate according to Front Face's orientation)
	B 	Back
	
	L 	Left
	M 	Middle (rotate according to Left Face's orientation)
	R 	Right
	
	U 	Up
	E 	Equator (rotate according to Up Face's orientation)
	D 	Down



	ENTIRE CUBE ROTATION COMMANDS
	
	X   Rotate entire cube according to Right Face's orientation
	Y   Rotate entire cube according to Up Face's orientation
	Z   Rotate entire cube according to Front Face's orientation


//PRIVATE KEYS//

Alice(User) Private Key: Take a0 & a1 input from user

Bob(Computer) Private Key: Generate random b0 & b1 for computer


//MANIPULATE CUBES//

//Step 1
Alice Actions: cubeA = Iterate through G a0 
Bob Actions: cubeB = Iterate through  G b0 

//Step 2
Alice Actions: cubeB = Iterate through G a0 & H a1 
Bob Actions: cubeA = Iterate through  G b0 & H b1

//Step 3
Alice Actions: cubeA = Iterate through H a1 
Bob Actions: cubeB = Iterate through  H b1

Cubes should match!


** EXTRAS **

- Reset button for Cubes

- Taking user input for G & H by reading cube rotations
