Public Parameters: Take G & H input (random or user input)

 (user input)
 create buttons to take cube moves (eg. "F" "Li" etc.)

Alice(User) Private Key: Take a0 & a1 input from user

Bob(Computer) Private Key: Generate random b0 & b1 for computer

//Step 1
Alice Actions: cubeA = Iterate through G a0 
Bob Actions: cubeB = Iterate through  G b0 

//Step 2
Alice Actions: cubeB = Iterate through G a0 & H a1 
Bob Actions: cubeA = Iterate through  G b0 & H b1

//Step 3
Alice Actions: cubeA = Iterate through H a1 
Bob Actions: cubeB = Iterate through  H b1

Cubes should match!
